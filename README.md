This repository contains 7 programs developed primarily to simulate waves. 
i)EM_wave code simulates electromagnetic waves when moving from one medium to another. 
ii)circular_motion_shm code potrays the relation between circular motion and SHM.
iii)forced_damped code simulates forced damped oscillations under various amount of forcings.
iv)guitar_string simulates waves produced on a guitar string.
v)resonance creates plots for resonance curves.
vi)VIBRATING_STRING file simulates a vibrating string considering beaded masses.
vii)GUITAR file simulates the E string of a bass guitar along with detialed analysis.
