Wave Simulation Programs
This repository contains seven programs developed primarily to simulate different types of wave phenomena. Each program focuses on a specific type of wave or oscillatory motion, offering detailed simulations and analysis.

1. EM_wave
Simulates electromagnetic waves as they propagate between two media with different properties, demonstrating reflection, transmission, and characteristic impedance effects.

2. circular_motion_shm
Illustrates the relationship between circular motion and simple harmonic motion (SHM), showcasing how uniform circular motion can represent SHM in one dimension.

3. forced_damped
Simulates forced damped oscillations under varying levels of external forcing. This program visualizes the impact of damping and external force on oscillatory systems.

4. guitar_string
Simulates the wave motion produced on a guitar string, providing an analysis of the resulting vibrations and the factors that influence the sound produced.

5. resonance
Generates plots of resonance curves, showing how amplitude varies with frequency in resonant systems, and visualizing the conditions under which resonance occurs.

6. VIBRATING_STRING
Simulates a vibrating string modeled with discrete beaded masses. This approach captures the wave propagation along the string with more granularity.

7. GUITAR
Models the E string of a bass guitar with a detailed analysis of the waveforms produced. This program also explores factors such as string tension and frequency to provide insights into the tonal characteristics.
