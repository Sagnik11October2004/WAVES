\maketitle

This repository contains seven programs developed primarily to simulate different types of wave phenomena. Each program focuses on a specific type of wave or oscillatory motion, offering detailed simulations and analysis.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{EM\_wave} \\
    Simulates electromagnetic waves as they propagate between two media with different properties, demonstrating reflection, transmission, and characteristic impedance effects.
    
    \item \textbf{circular\_motion\_shm} \\
    Illustrates the relationship between circular motion and simple harmonic motion (SHM), showcasing how uniform circular motion can represent SHM in one dimension.
    
    \item \textbf{forced\_damped} \\
    Simulates forced damped oscillations under varying levels of external forcing. This program visualizes the impact of damping and external force on oscillatory systems.
    
    \item \textbf{guitar\_string} \\
    Simulates the wave motion produced on a guitar string, providing an analysis of the resulting vibrations and the factors that influence the sound produced.
    
    \item \textbf{resonance} \\
    Generates plots of resonance curves, showing how amplitude varies with frequency in resonant systems, and visualizing the conditions under which resonance occurs.
    
    \item \textbf{VIBRATING\_STRING} \\
    Simulates a vibrating string modeled with discrete beaded masses. This approach captures the wave propagation along the string with more granularity.
    
    \item \textbf{GUITAR} \\
    Models the E string of a bass guitar with a detailed analysis of the waveforms produced. This program also explores factors such as string tension and frequency to provide insights into the tonal characteristics.
\end{enumerate}
